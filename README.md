# Unet2d-Infarct
# ImageSegmentation With Unet2d
> This is an example of segmentation of the core infarct area of the brain

## How to Use

the image files path is in the csv files,and put the image on the path,use the unet2d_trian.py file train the model. 

training the model on the GTX1080,it take 20 hours,and i also attach the trained model in the project,you also just use the unet2d_test.py file to predict,and get the segmentation result.

download trained model : https://pan.baidu.com/s/17p5lNKSNfWvFtn1KujjVbQ passport: hto4
